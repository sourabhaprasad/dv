**Calculated Fields in Tableau**

To demonstrate **Calculated Fields** on the given dataset using Tableau, we will create a **sales goal** based on a **20% increase** in sales performances. The company wants to analyze all states where they have achieved a minimum of **100 customers**. For states with fewer than **100 customers**, we will calculate the sales that would result if they had **100 customers**. We will create a **bullet chart** to visualize the **states**, **number of customers**, and **actual sales goal**.
Answer the following questions:

- Which state has the lowest count and what is the count?
- How many states have customer count atleast 100?

**Parameters in Tableau**

To illustrate the concept of **Parameters** using Tableau, we will create a dynamic view that allows a retail chain to analyze its performance in terms of **sales**, **profit**, and **profit ratio**. The manager will be able to select various measures and dimensions dynamically, such as **Sub-Category**, **Region**, and **Customer Name**.
Answer the following questions:

**Joins and Data Extract in Tableau**

To illustrate the concept of **Joins** and **Data Extracts** using Tableau, we will help Rollin Ford, the regional manager of a retail chain, analyze **profit** for each state along with the names of managers and the number of products returned by customers in each state. We will combine data from different tables and create a visualization to meet these requirements, while also enhancing performance through data extracts.

**Identifying High-Return Customers by Region**

To create a list of customers who have returned more than half of their distinct orders in each region, we will use a left join between the Orders and Returns tables in Tableau. This will allow us to identify customers with a high return rate and visualize the results by region.

- Create a visualization and answer the following questione
  - Which region has the highest number of products returned by the customers? (Hint: Change the view to text)
  - How many customers do you have on your list?

**Illustrating Reference Line, Trend Line, and Forecasting in Tableau**

To assist the CEO of a retail company in preparing for the annual meetings, we will create a visualization that shows the sales trend of the company, including future sales forecasts and a reference line for average sales. This analysis will also allow us to calculate the R-Squared value for an Exponential Trend model and the P-value for a Polynomial Trend model with Degree 3.

- What is the R-Squared value for an Exponential Trend model?
- What is the P value for a Polynomial Trend model with Degree 3?
